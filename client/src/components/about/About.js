        To those of you who love music more than commercialism,
        popularity contests, vanity metrics, selling out, rat races, etc, et cetera, ETC...</p>
      <p className="about__blurb about__bold-text">Welcome to MobiusTones.</p>
      <p className="about__blurb">This is a digital platform devoted exclusively to indie artists.</p>
      
      <p className="about__blurb">"Struggling artist" is just a pejorative term for someone who doesn't want to
        sell themselves out, or sell themselves short.</p>
        <p className="about__blurb about__bold-text">We are redefining things.</p>
      <p className="about__blurb">If you love, adore, live for, live by, need music, and would rather spend
        your time creating, sharing, and listening to music, rather than drown in the
        boring pursuit of 'mastering'
        the algorithms on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music just to share your music,
        you are welcome here.</p>
      <p className="about__blurb">We are taking back our power. From the big name artists who clog the market,
        to the big name platforms that only celebrate the superstars.
      </p>
      <p className="about__blurb">Find your people here. Your fans. Your collaborators.
      </p>
      <p className="about__blurb about__bold-text">Hear and be heard.</p>
      <p className="about__blurb">We need your music. We need people like you.</p>
